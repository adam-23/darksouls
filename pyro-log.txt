Day 1 

I woke from my sleep with the toll of a bell reverberating endlessly in my ears.
I carry the axe I was ritually buried in, and some relics from the Great Swamp.
Why am I here now? All I remember from before is a great Flame.

Why am I here? What am I doing?
I fucking hate axes.
Seem to be in some sort of graveyard.
Found a bonfire. Carrying on.

Found a coiled bonfire sword embedded in a corpse.
Corpse revived and tried to kill me with his halberd. Is now dead.
Halberd fucker morphed into a writhing black demon. Killed that too.
After killing the gravekeeper, I felt a rush of internal fire and strength.
I felt the foggy memory of my past life break through for a moment. 
"EMBER", it whispered.
I only remember glimpses of what came before.
Was I successful before my great sleep?

    
Found a shrine just above the bonfire. It's darkened. 
I used the coiled sword to ignite the ash in the center of the shrine to a bonfire.
Couple thrones exist in the bonfire. I am told they house the Lords.
The Firekeeper's magic and my own souls conquered from the miserable Hollows in the graveyard have given me new vigor.
The Shrine Maiden and Blacksmith have also proven helpful.


What are the purpose of these Lords?
The firekeeper has told me about their duty; to link The First Flame.
Why must this flame be lit?
Can it be manipulated, as if by my own pyromancy?

I am told that my rising from the bell toll and my own Embered form grant me the potential to become a Lord. 
But I am told that right now, all I am is meager Ash.
"ASH SEEKETH EMBER," another memory.
Why have I been awakened?

In the morning after I rest I will journey to the High Wall of Lothric in order to conquer it too.

Day 2

The Wall is a bitch. 
Weaker imitations of the writhing demon have burst out of the flesh of some of these Hollows.
Fire is extremely effective in eliminating them.
I have collected some titanite in hopes of pleasing the smith.
I encountered a dragon. Not a speared wyvern like in the swamp, but an honest dragon.
I ran, obviously.

I also found a sword and sturdy little silver shield. 
I quickly threw out my old axe and wooden shield.
They were useless anyway.

At the bottom of the wall I found the High Priestess of Lothric. 
She urged me to conquer the other Lords and to take on their power, and I accepted.
She gifted me with a banner for the messengers, and told me to watch out for The Hound.
She was a little vague about The Hound. Carrying on.

Figured out what she meant by the fucking hound.
Some great hunched-over beast of a man appeared through a black magic fission in the wall.
This monstrous knight had thighs thicker than my entire torso.
He felt... icy and otherworldly. 
Fire worked immensely well on the mutt. Is dead, am now stronger.
Resting now. Glad to be done with the wall.
